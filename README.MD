# spotify-reorder
Simple program I made to fulfill my weirds organizational needs in my spotify playlists.
Also a good way to learn rust, I think. Maybe someone with the same weird needs will benefit
of it. [Go follow me now >:(](https://open.spotify.com/user/315j3afyl5qddhiolfjyrwsv3wna).

If you want to run it then create a env file with your app credentials, see the rspotify
reference for futher information.
## Todo
- [x] Implement token caching
- [ ] Implement the option to change the ordering parameters
- [ ] Proper handle duplicated musics
- [ ] Rework sorting system (does it need to sort the array first to then reorder the playlist?)
